# Pokemon_Database
 
## Overview
 This application was made to help improve my skills in swift and get back into this programming language. I have worked in the past with this laguages but have never worked with some of the new changes such as SwiftUI that was used in this project. The project takes advantage of some ecternal libraries and APIs such as AlamoFire, and SwiftyJSON.

## To-Do
 This application still has a lot of work and things to add, there are some bugs that I am aware of that need some work but most importantly there are some features missing. Most notibly is the lack of evolution tracking. This is a feature that is partly implimented but I am having trouble getting the needed data for this from the online database.
